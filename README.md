# Peel-IA-Migration-HTML-Generator
* Inception: Nov, 2022
* This exists because Natasha asked for help with a python project to use a spreadsheet to template-out fragmented HTML, part of the Peel migration to the Internet Archive
* [Natasha's Sandbox mock-up](https://library.ualberta.ca/sandbox/natasha/peel/newspapers)
* For instance, [Search IA for "The Advertiser and Central Alberta News"](https://archive.org/search.php?query=the%20advertiser%20and%20central%20alberta%20news)
* Python Reference: [Reading CVS Files in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reading-csv-files-in-python/)
